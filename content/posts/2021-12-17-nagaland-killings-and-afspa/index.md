AFSPA is the abbreviated form of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act. It is the act that was established in 1958 after the assent of the President and which aims to control violence in the “disturbed areas” to protect the country through insurgents. Disturbed areas are the areas where the use of the army is necessary for addition to the civil police. Ministry of Home affairs declares the state as a “disturbed area” with an exception of declaring the state as disturbed for the state government in some areas. Also, the state government also gives suggestions to the Ministry of Home Affairs for the enactment of the areas as “disturbed areas”. According to the Disturb Areas (Special Courts)Act, 1976, if put up, that will remain applicable for the straight three months. 
This act provides the army with a shield and they can exercise various functions which include :
They can prohibit the gathering of more than five persons, 
They can also use fire and force as the result of a contravention of laws after giving due warning. 
They can also arrest without a warrant if one suspects to be an insurgent.
The possession of arms and weapons is strictly prohibited in these areas.
These exercises can be practised only in the states and territories that are under AFSPA.



Nagaland Killings:
The debate regarding the recent killings of Fifteen civilians by the Army in the event of presumed inaccurate recognition in Nagaland has again raised the credibility of the powers of the Javans. Six civilians who were killed were the coal miners who were killed when they were transferring the coal from the Teru area to Oting in their village. After the incident took place, five hundred plus people attacked and vandalised the paramilitary camp of the Assam Rifles in district headquarters of Mon where other nine died and some were injured. On the other hand, one Army Javan was also martyred during this violence. Section 144 was also imposed during the violent protest. The bulk SMS’s and data services were suspended in the entire district. These killings have been criticised by many people including Meghalaya and Nagaland Chief Minister, Neiphiu Rio and Conral Sangama respectively. The investigation is in the process by the Special Investigation Team.
Controversy :
The demand for the repeal of AFSPA has been raised by many people which includes the CM of Meghalaya and Nagaland, national political parties, civil society organisations etc. This incident will help the Naga separatists and insurgents to invade and tarnish the image and credibility of the Indian Army. Also, they also got a strong point in fulfilling their agenda of the separate flag and constitution. The investigation should be taken as this type of negligibility is a serious issue and the intention of the act should be verified immediately and punishment should be granted if something fishy is found out.
Arguments by the army :
The army, on the other hand, says that the repeal of the AFSPA will give the passage to the insurgents the protection and the violation of human rights will increase due to this. They argue that the act is necessary to combat insurgency. There is a need to protect the Army’s morality and integrity as a reason to not scrutinize the allegations against the Army personnel.
States that are currently under AFSPA:
Nagaland 
Arunachal Pradesh
    Jammu and Kashmir 
Assam
Meghalaya
    Manipur
Mizoram
Supreme court Judgment :
The attention of the supreme court of India in 2016 on the extra judicial killings clarified the fact that any unjustified killing by the Army personnel will not be granted the shield or the blanket cover from the punishments constituted under CrPC.
What lies ahead?
AFSPA should be amended if not repealed and the balance between the citizen-friendly and army friendly laws should be made regarding this.
Human Rights Violation is the biggest question raised on the credibility of the Indian Army. There is a need to re-establish the need to deal with the problem.
  The investigations should be done for the extra judicial killings, and the person responsible should be punished if found guilty.
Development is the other factor that contributes to the insurgency in the region which needs to be given due attention.
The permanent and the important of all the steps that should be taken is the negotiation and the dialogue between the Indian government and the insurgents which needs to be taken care of as the utmost priority.
