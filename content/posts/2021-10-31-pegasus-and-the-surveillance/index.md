How does it work?

It enables remote surveillance of smartphones by tracking personal details like GPS, photographs, videos, contact details, audio, etc. Pegasus is a very expensive malware designed to have surveillance on the interested parties. A message is sent on the victim's phone and when one clicks on it, the spyware gets into the phone. In some cases, it is also caused by ‘Zero click vulnerability’ that means a link will be sent to your phone and the pegasus will automatically present in your phone.

## Prevention from Pegasus:

This virus can be prevented if one gives their phone numbers to only their closed ones as this virus needs the phone number to have the virus in your phone and it can also be prevented if the phone is in VPN mode as it helps to hide the location of the individual.
