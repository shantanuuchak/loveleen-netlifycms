As we all know that, we live in a patriarchal society like India where domestic violence is an entrenched problem for years and which only intensified in recent years. **According to the NCRB or National Crime Records Bureau report of “Crime in India,2019”, about 70 % of the women which is too worrisome for us as the citizens of the country are victims of Domestic violence.** And heinous crimes like rape or Marital rape to be precise are likely to occur as the next step of domestic violence. 

Marital rape is the act of forcing your spouse into having intercourse without proper consent, is an unjust yet uncommon way to degrade and disempower women. The concept of Marital Rape in India is the epitome of what we call “implied consent”.Marriage between a man and a woman here implies that both have consented to sexual intercourse and it can not be otherwise. The Indian Penal Code, 1860 also communicates the same. The aforementioned paradox is not mere fiction but exists as a reality. One of the most horrifying and repressive issues with the Indian legal regime is that Marital Rape is perfectly legal in India. 

Indian Penal Code provides the punishment to the crimes which includes Section 375 of rape as a crime when the intercourse is done without the due consent of the partner. An exception of Section 375 has the provision stated as  “ Sexual intercourse by a man with his own wife, the wife not being under fifteen years of age, is not rape ” which only demeans the women and disempowers them.

Despite that rape laws in our country continues with the patriarchal outlook of considering women to be the property of men post-marriage, with no autonomy or agency over their bodies. They deny married women equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Indian constitution which is a violation of Article 14 (Equality for all ). Lawmakers fail to understand that marriage should not be viewed as a license for a husband to forcibly rape his wife with impunity. A married woman has the same right to control her own body as does an unmarried woman.

In spite of recent amendments in criminal law, various laws meant to protect women from domestic violence and sexual assault have largely remained ineffective. But what happens when laws provide a safeguard to the culprits and endanger the victims?

**Also, according to the World Bank, 100+ Developed Nations have criminalised Marital Rape and India includes comes in 36 nations which do not criminalise Marital Rape as a crime. It is the sole act of disempowerment of women.**

An analysis of NFHS or National Family Health survey 2015-16 data indicates that an estimated 99.1% of sexual violence go unreported and that an average Indian woman is 17 times more likely to face sexual offences from her husband than from others.

The amendments regarding the rape laws have been done many times in 1983,2002,2013 and 2018.

In the 2013 amendment act which is the result of the Nirbhaya Case, it expanded the definition of rape as oral sex in addition to the insertion of any object into a women’s vagina, urethra or anus will amount to rape.

In 2018, after the Kathua Rape case, the minimum punishment for rape was extended from 7-10 years.

The fact that, in all amendments, there is no recognition of Marital rape by the government is a troublesome situation in our country. After the Nirbhaya gang-rape case, Justice Verma Committee suggested criminalising Marital Rape which was opposed by the parliamentary committee on the argument that it will disrupt the family system of India.

**Fact: According to the NCRB report of 2018, In every 16 minutes, one woman is raped and in every 4 minutes, at least one woman is the victim of domestic violence.**

Thus, Marital rape remained a stereotype that Domestic violence or Rape can only occur outside their homes and women are safe in their own houses which is not at all true.
