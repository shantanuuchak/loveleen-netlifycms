India is changing and building a robust ecosystem for setting up startups in India. To encourage the startups, the Government of India has started a flagship program called “Startup India initiative”, **“MUDRA”**, **“Startup India Seed Fund”** etc. to assist the aspiring entrepreneurs financially. Our Prime Minister once quoted **“Take up one idea.
