## What is Rape?

Rape is a heinous crime that involves involuntary sexual intercourse. Back then, it was believed that it is only done by men and not by women but now a rapist is anyone who is committing involuntary sexual intercourse i.e. women’s, men’s, same-gender intercourse.

 It is often envisaged as a result of an uprooted form of patriarchy in which women are suppressed by men and treated as ‘’men's property”. Most cases of rape are unreported to protect the “family honor” in society. Survivors in some cases are under family pressure to not report the case or will be killed by them, some are not in the condition to report as they are physically and mentally disturbed. In the 21st century, women’s safety should be of foremost importance. The slow process of justice given by the judiciary, unreported cases, and some statements made by someone results in promoting rape.

Recently a statement was made by a “UP Women’s Commissioner”, Mrs. Meena Kumari in response to the public hearing of complaints about women in Aligarh district. She stated that ‘’Girls should not be given mobile phones as girls talks to boys for hours and then elope with them, their phones should be checked too’’. 

This is promoting the crimes against women as women are shown as the “ culprit” of the crimes. 

Why should only girls' phones be checked? Why not boys? Are they not eloping with girls or are they not responsible for anything?

The patriarchal behavior of women against women is promoting crimes. There should be an offense regarding these statements which promotes “Gender targeting”. It is believed in  Indian society that if a woman is wearing the clothes they want to wear off “their “choice, to select a partner of “their “choice is a heinous crime and not crimes like rape because rapes are the result of women’s doing “their “thing.

The other instance of current Uttarakhand CM, Mr. Tirath Singh Rawat who remarked that women who wear ripped jeans are lack value. Just because a woman wears ripped jeans, she’s giving the wrong value to youngsters. Derogatory remarks like these against women are not acceptable at all.

Legal action should be taken against these remarks.
