## What is Free Speech?

Free speech is fundamental to every individual in democracies which provides people the immunity to present their opinions, suggestions, etc. without any censorship or prior approval but it has certain limitations and is not an absolute right. These limitations include national security, obscenity, pornography, incitement of communal violence, etc. but free speech in recent times has been curbed and in some cases requires prior approval to publish something which curbs free speech.



## How Free Speech is indirectly taken away?

#### In recent times, free speech is curbed by the government by the way of censorship, prior approval of information being published. 



Due to the spread of misinformation, disinformation, malinformation being spread online, the government of India has introduced new IT RULES, 2021 which are challenged by the social media intermediaries on the account that they are violating the freedom of speech and freedom of privacy enshrined under Article 19 and Article 21 of Indian constitution, respectively. In response, GOI told the high court that these rules are only to check the first originator of the fake information which is already in the public domain and the other argument was that the GOI will only ask to take down the content which is obscene, pornographic, or something which harms someone.



The other instance of prior approval was when the Education Minister of India notified the government universities to conduct an online international seminar with the prior approval of the Minister of External Affairs on sensitive topics like Jammu and Kashmir,  North East, or any sensitive matter which are political, scientific, defense, etc. related to India’s internal matters.

The recent G7+ summit also raised the issues of the internet ban in Jammu & Kashmir after the abrogation of Article 370 which curbs free speech as without the internet there can not be ground reporting of things happening in Jammu and Kashmir. The G7+ summit stated the internet shutdowns in Jammu & Kashmir as politically motivated.

## Why Free Speech is important?



All instances show how free speech is being taken away by the government which is not healthy for the Indian democracy also known as the largest democracy in the world. Freedom of speech is very important in a healthy democracy because it gives the people a sense of choice to make the right decisions, to aware the people about things, it narrows the gap between majority and marginalized or minority, it provides new ideas to perform something innovatively, etc.
