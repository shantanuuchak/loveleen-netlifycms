The administrator of Lakshadweep, **Mr. Praful K Patel**, recently introduced some reforms that the general public opposed. People on large scale are protesting across these laws which are as follows:

## **1. Two child policy for elections**

This reform says that if a resident of Lakshadweep has more than two children, then he/she is prohibited to contest elections at the local level or panchayat election.

## **2. Sale of liquor**

This reform allows the sale of liquor in the island nation to promote tourism. It was allowed only in the region of Bangaram island from which no one could carry the liquor to another island.

## **3. Beef ban**

Lakshadweep Animal Preservation Regulation,2021 bans the slaughter of cows, bulls, etc. The sale and purchase of beef are banned under this reform. Persons who slaughter without a certificate are liable under this reform. The punishment includes imprisonment for up to one year and a fine of up to 10,000 INR.

## **4. Land reforms**

Under Lakshadweep Development Authority Regulation, the government can grab any land for development activities like mining, quarrying, building, etc. This reform is highly discriminatory against the general public as the land can be retained anytime by the officials in the name of development.

## **5. Anti-social activities**

Under Prevention of anti-social activities,2021, the government has the immunity to detain a person without any ''public disclosure'' for up to one year.  People are opposing this as there is a very low crime rate in the island nation, which can be against their own agendas.
